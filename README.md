## Recommendations

- Implement weekend promotions or loyalty discounts to increase transactions on Saturday and Sunday.

- Weekend-specific promotions (e.g., "Weekend Brunch Specials" or "Buy One, Get One Free") to attract more customers.
- Promote Barista Espresso as a premium offering to maintain high revenue margins.
- Reduce staffing during 6 AM and 8 PM due to low customer traffic.
- Offer early morning discounts (6-8 AM) and evening happy hour deals (6-8 PM) to boost sales during slow periods.
